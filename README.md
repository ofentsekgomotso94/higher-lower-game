# higher-lower-game
This is a day-14 challenge from Angela Yu's 100-days-of-python. It is part of my python journey to achieve that 100 days milestone.

This is a python file. Has no user interface and can be accessed and played from your terminal.

TO PLAY THE GAME:
1. Open your terminal: CMD for windows, which I use.(Not familiar with other OS's but as long as its a terminal, it is supposed to work.)
2. Change directories to this file, provided you have downloaded it.
3. Type "python main.py" and play the game.

NOTE: I am a python beginner, therefore my code may contain lots of BUGS. 
      HOWEVER, I have also uploaded Angela Yu's Version which is bug free, Hopefully.
      Just type "python main0.py" and check her version.
      
Any feedback would be highly appreciated.
